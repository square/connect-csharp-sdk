**CatalogObjectId** | **string** | The Square generated ID of the &#x60;CatalogObject&#x60; being tracked. | [optional] 
**CatalogObjectType** | **string** | The &#x60;CatalogObjectType&#x60; of the &#x60;CatalogObject&#x60; being tracked. Tracking is only supported for the &#x60;ITEM_VARIATION&#x60; type. | [optional]

For example, &#x60;2.5&#x60; will become &#x60;2&#x60;, and &#x60;-2.5&#x60; will become &#x60;-3&#x60;.
