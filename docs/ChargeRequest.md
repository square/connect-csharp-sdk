## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**IdempotencyKey** | **string** | A value you specify that uniquely identifies this transaction among transactions you&#39;ve created.  If you&#39;re unsure whether a particular transaction succeeded, you can reattempt it with the same idempotency key without worrying about double-charging the buyer.  See [Idempotency keys](#idempotencykeys) for more information. | 
**AmountMoney** | [**Money**](Money.md) | The amount of money to charge.  Note that you specify the amount in the __smallest denomination of the applicable currency__. For example, US dollar amounts are specified in cents. See [Working with monetary amounts](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/working-with-monetary-amounts) for details.  The value of &#x60;currency&#x60; must match the currency associated with the business that is charging the card. | 
**CardNonce** | **string** | A nonce generated from the &#x60;SqPaymentForm&#x60; that represents the card to charge.  The application that provides a nonce to this endpoint must be the _same application_ that generated the nonce with the &#x60;SqPaymentForm&#x60;. Otherwise, the nonce is invalid.  Do not provide a value for this field if you provide a value for &#x60;customer_card_id&#x60;. | [optional] 
**CustomerCardId** | **string** | The ID of the customer card on file to charge. Do not provide a value for this field if you provide a value for &#x60;card_nonce&#x60;.  If you provide this value, you _must_ also provide a value for &#x60;customer_id&#x60;. | [optional] 
**DelayCapture** | **bool?** | If &#x60;true&#x60;, the request will only perform an Auth on the provided card. You can then later perform either a Capture (with the &#x60;CaptureTransaction&#x60; or a Void (with the &#x60;VoidTransaction&#x60;.  Default value: &#x60;false&#x60; | [optional]

**BillingAddress** | [**Address**](Address.md) | The buyer&#39;s billing address. This value is optional, but this transaction is ineligible for chargeback protection if neither this parameter nor &#x60;shipping_address&#x60; is provided. | [optional] 
**ShippingAddress** | [**Address**](Address.md) | The buyer&#39;s shipping address, if available. This value is optional, but this transaction is ineligible for chargeback protection if neither this parameter nor &#x60;billing_address&#x60; is provided. | [optional] 
**BuyerEmailAddress** | **string** | The buyer&#39;s email address, if available. This value is optional, but this transaction is ineligible for chargeback protection if it is not provided. | [optional] 
**OrderId** | **string** | The ID of the order to associate with this transaction.  If you provide this value, the &#x60;amount_money&#x60; value of your request must __exactly match__ the value of the order&#39;s &#x60;total_money&#x60; field. | [optional] 
**AdditionalRecipients** | [**List&lt;AdditionalRecipient&gt;**](AdditionalRecipient.md) | The basic primitive of multi-party transaction. The value is optional. The transaction facilitated by you can be split from here.  If you provide this value, the &#x60;amount_money&#x60; value in your additional_recipients must not be more than 90% of the &#x60;amount_money&#x60; value in the charge request. The &#x60;location_id&#x60; must be the valid location of the app owner merchant.  This field requires the &#x60;PAYMENTS_WRITE_ADDITIONAL_RECIPIENTS&#x60; OAuth permission.
