## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Name** | **string** | The discount name. Searchable. This field has max length of 255 Unicode code points. | [optional] 
**DiscountType** | **string** | Indicates whether the discount is a fixed amount or percentage, or entered at the time of sale. See [CatalogDiscountType](#type-catalogdiscounttype) for possible values | [optional] 
**Percentage** | **string** | The percentage of the discount as a string representation of a decimal number, using a &#x60;.&#x60; as the decimal separator and without a &#x60;%&#x60; sign. A value of &#x60;7.5&#x60; corresponds to &#x60;7.5%&#x60;. Specify a percentage of &#x60;0&#x60; if &#x60;discount_type&#x60; is &#x60;VARIABLE_PERCENTAGE&#x60;.  Do not include this field for amount-based or variable discounts. | [optional] 
**AmountMoney** | [**Money**](Money.md) | The amount of the discount. Specify an amount of &#x60;0&#x60; if &#x60;discount_type&#x60; is &#x60;VARIABLE_AMOUNT&#x60;.  Do not include this field for percentage-based or variable discounts. | [optional] 
**PinRequired** | **bool?** | Indicates whether a mobile staff member needs to enter their PIN to apply the discount to a payment in the Square Point of Sale app. | [optional] 
**LabelColor** | **string** | The color of the discount display label in the Square Point of Sale app. This must be a valid hex color code. | [optional] 
**ModifyTaxBasis** | **string** | Indicates whether this discount should reduce the price used to calculate tax.  Most discounts should use &#x60;MODIFY_TAX_BASIS&#x60;. However, in some circumstances taxes must be calculated based on an item&#39;s price, ignoring a particular discount. For example, in many US jurisdictions, a manufacturer coupon or instant rebate reduces the price a customer pays but does not reduce the sale price used to calculate how much sales tax is due. In this case, the discount representing that manufacturer coupon should have &#x60;DO_NOT_MODIFY_TAX_BASIS&#x60; for this field.  If you are unsure whether you need to use this field, consult your tax professional. See [CatalogDiscountModifyTaxBasis](#type-catalogdiscountmodifytaxbasis) for possible values | [optional]
